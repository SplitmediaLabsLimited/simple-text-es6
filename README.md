# Simple Text - ES6

A simple source plugin to place a text on your scene that is fully customizable in terms of CSS.

This plugin was made as a sample of a ES6-based development environment with [XSplit JS Framework](http://xjsframework.github.io/). Please check the `package.json` file to check out the tools used to create this plugin.

If you are a developer, you might be interested on making use of the webpack configuration file for your own ES6 based projects. You can also swap the [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) with [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) to start a TypeScript based project.
